# Midjourney Client

Forked from oelin/midjourney-client

A minimal client for Midjourney's hosted inference API on Replicate. This package allows you to easily access Midjourney/Openjourney from NodeJS.

> Openjourney is an open source Stable Diffusion fine tuned model on Midjourney images, by [PromptHero](https://prompthero.com/). Predictions run on Nvidia A100 GPU hardware.

## Installation

```js
npm i midjourney-client
```


## API

The API is super simple; just enter your prompt and `await` for one or more image URLs. One image is returned by default.

```js
await midjourney('a painting of a ginger cat.')
```

Pass in additional parameters as a second argument.

```js
await midjourney('a painting of a ginger cat.', { width: 1024 })
```

A complete list of supported parameters can be found [here](https://replicate.com/prompthero/openjourney/api#inputs).

## Future

- Improve API interfaces (i.e. return richer objects than just arrays of URLs).
- Merge/become part of Replicated/ReplicateJS.
